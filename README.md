G Suite APIs Intro codelab
==========================

This codelab introduces developers to G Suite APIs (Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, Sheets, Slides, etc.) by writing a simple Python script that lists the first 100 files/folders in a user's Google Drive. Access it at http://g.co/codelabs/gsuite-apis-intro.

Introduction
------------

This codelab introduces you to using G Suite (REST/HTTP) APIs. The example will be done in Python for brevity and wide availability, but you can also choose to use your favorite development language. You'll learn how to use the developer console to create and manage projects, including obtaining the credentials you'll need in your app. With the formalities taken care of, you'll write an app to display the first 100 files & folders in your Google Drive by using the Drive API.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- A Google account
- Basic Python skills (but you can build the sample using [any supported language](http://developers.google.com/api-client-library)
- Python 2 or 3 installed on your development machine
- Some files and/or folders in your [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com)
